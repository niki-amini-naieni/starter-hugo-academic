My doctoral research will involve developing novel deep learning models and algorithms that generalize well to new environments.

As machine learning models are beginning to be applied to high-risk problems such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, it has become increasingly important that these models learn meaningful patterns in data. Models that learn meaningful relationships, as opposed to spurious correlations, should be able to make accurate predictions on data sampled from domains different from the ones the training data were sampled from. This capability is necessary for deep learning models to operate effectively and predictably in novel environments such as in new cities, hospitals, and landscapes. The machine learning community has framed this need more formally as the problem of **_domain generalization_** in which the aim is to design models that make accurate predictions on data sampled from a distribution different from the training distribution.

Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.03097.pdf).")

I will focus on the theory of domain generalization as well as its applications. I am motivated both by the theoretical rigour of my work and its real-world implications.
