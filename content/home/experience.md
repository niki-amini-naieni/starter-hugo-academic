      Created intelligent robotic arm system for phased array antenna calibration and measurements using computer
      vision techniques and robotics software library developed during previous internship. This system learns the
      phased array under test through a short (few minutes) teaching process requiring a single annotated image.
      After this teaching phase, vision system robustly detects the phased array learned in new, varying images and
      guides the 6-axis robotic arm to all requested antenna elements on the detected phased array’s surface. Also
      served as an expert on previous software-related developments.

      Using 6-axis robotic arm, created mmWave systems utilized for the calibration and measurement of Kuiper’s
      customer terminal antenna. To more closely integrate these systems into the Antenna Team’s work, developed
      custom robotics software library used extensively by the Kuiper Team to design innovative phased array antenna
      calibration algorithms and tests.

      Invented a software engine using novel mathematical techniques for the rapid analysis and synthesis of phased
      array antenna beamforming. This novel engine is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than off-the-shelf versions.

      Developed new software tool that completely automates the initial via transition design process, significantly
      reducing the time required to design and simulate via transitions (reduces hours to a few minutes). Furthermore,
      this tool allows antenna engineers to add design components they were previously unable to add without
      significant effort. Created wireless communication system that allows users to remotely control and monitor
      a signal generator and spectrum analyzer in real time. Development required extensive programming, user
      interface design, and creating electrical interfaces between the systems.
