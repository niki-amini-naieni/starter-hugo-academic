I am a rising DPhil student in [Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/autonomous-intelligent-machines-and-systems) at the University of Oxford. I am fully funded by AWS, the [Oxford-Singapore Human-Machine Collaboration Initiative](https://www.mpls.ox.ac.uk/latest/upcoming-events/oxford-2013-singapore-human-machine-collaboration-launch-event), and an [Oxford-Reuben scholarship](https://reuben.ox.ac.uk/funding-your-studies). My doctoral research will focus on both theoretical and applied machine learning. 

I am a research consultant as well. I work on problems related to machine learning, computer vision, space, and robotics and develop advanced software tools as solutions. I also provide 1:1 consulting services, as opposed to end-to-end project development, to clients interested in learning more about topics related to my past industry research experiences and my current research in academia.

Over the past few years, I have completed projects for teams at both Amazon's [Project Kuiper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_Systems) and SpaceX's [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) constellation during internships (Amazon & SpaceX) and as a full-time consultant (Amazon). My past projects have spanned the topics of robotics, computer vision, phased array antenna simulation and development, applied math and physics, and software engineering.
