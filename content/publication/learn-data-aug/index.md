abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for learning data augmentations for domain generalization. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on Camelyon17-WILDS, a dataset for tumor classification across different hospitals, PovertyMap-WILDS, a dataset for poverty mapping across different countries, FMoW-Wilds, a dataset for land use classification across different regions and years, and ColoredMNIST, a dataset of colored handwritten digits.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  We propose a novel algorithm for learning data augmentations for domain generalization. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several real-world datasets.
