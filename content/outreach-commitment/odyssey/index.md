I mentor undergraduate students as a professional. Specifically, I help with career path development, build meaningful relationships with mentees, and provide resume, interview, academic, and general advice for students interested in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) careers. **If you are interested in being mentored by me, please sign up for Odyssey using the button above. Odyssey is completely free and will give you access to an army of other accomplished professionals in STEM subjects and in other industries such as finance. Professionals work at companies like Google, Amazon, Boston Consulting Group, J.P. Mogran, and Microsoft and hold free office hours just like I do.**
